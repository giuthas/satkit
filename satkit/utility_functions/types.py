    Return True if the object is a sequence but not a string.

    Note that this function returns False for numpy arrays which should be
    identified with `isinstance` and treated separately because they can be
    indexed with a different syntax. 

    Parameters
    ----------
    object : Any
        any object

    Returns
    -------
    bool
        True for sequences, False for strings and everything else.
